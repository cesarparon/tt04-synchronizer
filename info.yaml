  title:        "Clock synchronizer"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Testing different ways of clocks synchronizer to avoid metastability problem."


# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    This project is composed by different clock synchronizer subblocks. This subblocks have the functionality of mitigate the problem of metastability 
    caused when you have two clock domain. 
    Then, with a selector, you can select this different subblocks in order to test and measure their performance to avoid this problem.

    So, the project has:
    A first register at the input for register the data. This 8bits-length data is register by CLK1. 

    This data is register by another register but with another clock, in this case CLK2. The data of the output of this register
    has a lot of probability to be metastable. 

    The output of the first register is the input of the three different blocks to be tested.

    1- The first one, 2 flip-flop synchronizer, is composed by two register in cascade (A connected to B), triggered by CLK2. 
    There is probability that while sampling the input A-d by flip flop A in CLK2 clock domain, output A-q may go into metastable state.
    But during the one clock cycle period of CLK2 clock, output A-q may settle to some stable value. 
    Output of flop B can go to metastable if A does not settle to stable value during one clock cycle, but probability for B to be metastable for
    a complete destination clock cycle is very close to zero.

    
    2- The second, Recirculation mux synchronization, in order to synchronize data, a control pulse is generated in source clock domain (CLK1) when data is available at source flop.
    Control Pulse is then synchronized using 2 flip flop synchronizer or pulse synchronizer (Toggle or Handshake) depending on clock ratio between source (CLK1) and destination (CLK2) domain.
    Synchronized control pulse is used to sample the data on the bus in destination domain. Data should be stable until it is sampled in destination clock domain (CLK2).

    
    3- The third, Toggle synchronizer, is used to synchronize a pulse generating in source clock domain (CLK1) to destination clock domain (CLK2). 
    A pulse cannot be synchronized directly using 2 FF synchronizer. While synchronizing from fast clock domain (CLk2) to slow clock domain (CLk1) 
    using 2 FF synchronizer, the pulse can be skipped which can cause the loss of pulse detection and hence subsequent circuit which 
    depends upon it, may not function properly. 

   
    

      

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      First, you need to define the frequency you want to use with CLK1 (slow clock) and CLK (fast clock).
      After reset, you need to put a input data on data_in. 
      Then, you need to use the corresponding enable of the block you want to test, 
      and using the selector you can select the block. 
      You will see at the output the signal and examine if the signal has a metastable state or not. 
      Also, you can use the input stb and pulse_in to measure the performance of the blocks associated to this inputs. 

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:    
    - clk, clock of the first clock domain.
    - clk_2 connected to ui_in[0]. This is the second clock domain.
    - sel connected to ui_in[3:1]. This the selector tu select the different output between the different blocks.
    - pulse_in connected to ui_in[4]. This is the pulse needed to synchronize with the third block. 
    - stb connected ui_in[4]. This is the pulse needed to synchronize with the second block.
    - rst_n. Reset of the system. 
    - ena. Enable of the system.
    
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - data_out connected to uo_out. This is the data output of the different block depending of the value of sel.
    - uio_out
    - uio_oe
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - data_in connected to uio_in, set as input. This is the data input
